This is a python script which I used when I attented Youth Code Jam in September.
In order to get this running:

1.) install pip if you do not have it already (possibly to a virtual env)
    on my Ubuntu(Debian) system it is:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-pip

2.) install requirements for python script

    pip install -r requirements.txt
